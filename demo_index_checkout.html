    <h1>Animated Background</h1>
    <p>Move your mouse around to highlight edges and interact with the graph.</p>
    <p> .. </p>
<p>This graph isn't just code—it's a living network of ideas, relationships, and patterns.</p>
<p>Each node pulses with meaning; every edge connects stories from different domains.</p>
<p>At the center lies the origin—Node Zero—the first idea that sparked the network's birth.</p>
<p>As your mouse moves, connections ripple across the canvas, like neurons firing in a brain.</p>
<p>This is no ordinary background; it's an abstract map of thought, motion, and memory.</p>
<p>Follow the brightest path—it traces the journey of a concept evolving through time.</p>
<p>Edges thicken when ideas grow strong; they thin when neglected or forgotten.</p>
<p>The purple arc? It represents a forgotten branch of science, now re-emerging.</p>
<p>Hover near the top-left: that’s the domain of philosophy, full of quiet tension.</p>
<p>Scroll a bit, and you'll uncover hidden clusters—pockets of unexpected insight.</p>
<p>Some nodes glow brighter—those are core insights, echoed in many disciplines.</p>
<p>In this graph, data isn't just numbers—it’s the architecture of human curiosity.</p>
<p>Every pixel shift reflects a new thought forming in a sea of digital ideas.</p>
<p>Visualize how machine learning weaves patterns across seemingly unrelated nodes.</p>
<p>The orange burst on the right? That’s chaos theory intersecting with social networks.</p>
<p>This isn't art—it’s structured chaos, emerging from well-tuned randomness.</p>
<p>The layout changes slightly every time—no two sessions are quite the same.</p>
<p>There’s poetry in patterns and beauty in balanced noise.</p>
<p>Pause a moment—watch the edges pulse—notice how they respond to presence.</p>
<p>You’re not just a user—you’re part of the graph now.</p>
<p>Ideas move because you move.</p>
<p>The entire canvas is reactive—alive in code, electric in interpretation.</p>
<p>Zoom into the bottom-right: those faint threads? They represent discarded drafts.</p>
<p>This graph is a time capsule, recording intellectual evolution without judgment.</p>
<p>See how clusters form naturally, without rules? That's emergence at work.</p>
<p>Touch the edge of one cluster, and you might feel the weight of past knowledge.</p>
<p>Not all nodes are equal—some are bridges, some are islands, some are voids.</p>
<p>Notice the flicker when edges meet at sharp angles—it’s tension made visible.</p>
<p>There’s rhythm in randomness here—like jazz composed by algorithms.</p>
<p>Move faster—the graph reacts with more urgency, revealing its dynamic heart.</p>
<p>Stillness has a different effect—it calms the chaos, aligns the edges.</p>
<p>In this space, you are both observer and participant, both cause and effect.</p>
<p>Even the edges whisper stories—some of friendship, others of conflict.</p>
<p>Keep moving—there’s more to see, and it changes with every glance.</p>
<p>This system adapts, reflects, and occasionally surprises even its own creator.</p>
<p>Think of it as a mental mirror—what you see is shaped by how you look.</p>
<p>The darker regions? That's ambiguity. The glowing centers? That's clarity.</p>
<p>Watch how some edges dissolve—forgotten links in your mind’s encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Patterns emerge, not because they’re programmed, but because they’re inevitable.</p>
<p>This is not just visual stimulation—it’s cognitive architecture, made visible.</p>
<p>The longer you interact, the more the graph adapts, subtly and silently.</p>
<p>Zoom out and it becomes cosmic—like stars in a simulated universe.</p>
<p>Zoom in and it’s microscopic—like synapses firing between thoughts.</p>
<p>This is what complexity feels like: beautiful, unpredictable, and immersive.</p>
<p>Nothing here is accidental—even randomness has its role in revelation.</p>
<p>Behind this lies a script—but in front of it lies an experience.</p>
<p>You’ve seen a graph—but you’ve also seen a reflection of yourself in it.</p>
